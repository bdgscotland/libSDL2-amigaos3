    /* the 16-bit FixedPoint Body variables describe what percentage of
     * the entire body of stuff referred to by this Gadget is actually
     * shown at one time.  This is used with the AUTOKNOB routines,
     * to adjust the size of the AUTOKNOB according to how much of
     * the data can be seen.  This is also used to decide how far
     * to advance the Pots when User hits the Container of the Gadget.
     * For instance, if you were controlling the display of a 5-line
     * Window of text with this Gadget, and there was a total of 15
     * lines that could be displayed, you would set the VertBody value to
     *	   (MAXBODY / (TotalLines / DisplayLines)) = MAXBODY / 3.
     * Therefore, the AUTOKNOB would fill 1/3 of the container, and
     * if User hits the Cotainer outside of the knob, the pot would
     * advance 1/3 (plus or minus) If there's no body to show, or
     * the total amount of displayable info is less than the display area,
     * set the Body variables to the MAX.  To adjust these after the
     * Gadget is added to the System, use ModifyProp();
